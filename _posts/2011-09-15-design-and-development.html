  Ungainly does both web design and web development.
</p>

<p>
  In design instead of the 
  <a title="Siteinspire web design showcase" href="http://siteinspire.com/showcase">shiny, trendy</a> and
  <a title="Cargo Collective web design showcase" href="http://cargocollective.com/showcase">usual style</a>
  we create something <em class="highlight">unique, raw, ungainly</em>. 
</p>
  The world is not perfect so your web site should not hide behind 
  <a title="Designing imperfection" href="http://www.coolhunting.com/design/glitch-designin.php">perfectionism</a>.
