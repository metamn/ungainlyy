<p>
  You and me might have ideas what works best for your customers.
  </br>
  But let them make the final decision!
</p>

<p>
  Split testing presents two or more versions of the same website in a transparent way for visitors, for a short period of time. 
  <br/>
  Meantime in the background it measures which version is more effective to reach certain goals, like purchase and subscribe.
  <br/>
  Then the best performing version will become the final website. 
</p>

<p>
  You can ask if it worths the extra efforts of having two or more different designs. 
  <br/>
  If your business depends on conversion rates

  yes, it worths!</a>.
