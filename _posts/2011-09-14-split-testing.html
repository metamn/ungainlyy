<p>
  You and me might have ideas what works best for your customers.
  </br>
  But let them make the final decision!
</p>

<p>
  Split testing presents two or more versions of the same website for customers in a transparent way, for a short period of time. 
  <br/>
  Meantime in the background measures which version is more effective to reach certain goals, like purchase snd subscribe.
  <br/>
  Then the best performing version will become the final website. 
</p>

<p>
  You can ask if it worths the extra efforts of having two or more different designs. 
  <br/>
  Check this example where the conversion rate 
  <a title="Split testing at 37Signals" href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2991-behind-the-scenes-ab-testing-part-3-final">
  went up to 102%.</a> 
</p>
