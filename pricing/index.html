<h3>How much a website cost?</h3>
<p>
  In order to answer this <em>delicate</em> question let's first analyse what a website means in deliverables, 
  in the <strong>classic</strong> way.
</p>

  <a title="Folyo: How much a website costs" href="http://blog.folyo.me/post/10723370923/how-much-does-a-website-cost">a recent survey</a> 
  which helps us examine pricing:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A logo &mdash; <strong>$500 - $2,500</strong></li>
    <li>The design itself in Photoshop or wireframes &mdash; <strong>$1,000 - $5,000</strong></li>
    <li>The design for the mobile site &mdash; <strong>$1,000 - $5,000</strong>
    <li>
      The backend application, the so called Content Management System 
      (blog). The designs above adapted to web by web developers
      &mdash; <strong>$50 hourly rate * 6 days of work = $3,000</strong>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Adding up the averages you'll have a <strong>$10,000</strong> bill at the end.
  <br/>
  Which is quite okay verified through the

</p>

<h3>Delivering a website in 1-2 months</h3>
<p>
  Ungainlyy delivers a complete web site, with smartphone and tablet support, hosted in the cloud, optimized for search engines
  usually in less than 2 months for around <strong>$8,000</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  During the project you'll have to deal only with a single <em>nice guy</em> doing both the design & development.
